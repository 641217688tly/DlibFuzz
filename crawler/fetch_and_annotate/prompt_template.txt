This is an example of labelled buggy {} code snippet from {}'s github repository issues. 
You are asked to label other issues I provide in the format of the given snippet. 
You should figure out the API, title, URL, code, and description sections of the issue and process them according to the prompts bellow.
This may require your knowledge of {} and its common issues. 
For the API section, put the relevant APIs in an JSON array literal.
For the code section you only need to put the relevant code snippet instead of the full issue. 
If there is no code snippet provided in the issue, you should put an empty string "". 
Then, summarize the title and other content about how to reproduce the issue and put them in the description section. 
The description should contain 3 parts: the environment where the issue took place, the user's operation and the consequence of that operation.
Note that you should answer in JSON format. Do not add any Markdown syntax.

The example is as follows:
API: torch.compile
Title: 2nd compile of deepcopy(model) fails on multiple ubuntu-pc (fatal error: Python.h: file not found)
URL: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/128121
Code:
class Net(torch.nn.Module): # 10+10, N= 7960
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = torch.nn.Linear(784, 10)
        self.relu = torch.nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = torch.nn.Linear(10, 10)

    def forward(self, x): # line 59 from stderr log below
        z1 = self.fc1(torch.flatten(x, start_dim=1))
        z1 = self.fc2(self.relu(z1))
        return F.log_softmax(z1, dim=1)

# model is trivial Net above or ResNet (18 or 34 or Wide28 or 50)
model = torch.compile(model) # always ok
# here 10 epochs training (good progress, no issues)
model2 = deepcopy(model) # ok
model2 = torch.compile(model2) # fails (system dependent)
