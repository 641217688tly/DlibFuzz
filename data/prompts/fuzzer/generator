Background:
It is known that the API combinations from the PyTorch library {torch_apis}, TensorFlow library {tf_apis}, and Jax library {jax_apis} all have identical functionalities.


Task:
Generate code snippets for differential testing using API combinations from the aforementioned deep learning libraries.


Steps:
1.Review the code examples above that caused crashes in the deep learning libraries, and consider which operations might trigger errors or crashes in the libraries.
2.Begin generating code snippets that could expose errors or cause crashes in the deep learning libraries based on the insights from the previous step.
2.1 First, define variable values that can be used by API combinations from different libraries.
2.2 Then, generate calling code for the PyTorch API combination (if provided in the background).
2.3 Next, generate calling code for the TensorFlow API combination (if provided in the background).
2.4 Finally, generate calling code for the Jax API combination (if provided in the background).

Requirements:
1.Ensure that the necessary modules or APIs are imported in the code.
2.The code snippets using API combinations from different libraries should have the same input values.
3.The output values from running the code snippets of different library API combinations must be the same.
4.Use comments "# Pytorch", "# Tensorflow", and "# Jax" to separate the calling codes of different library API combinations.
5.Only output code and comments, and avoid other content (such as Markdown syntax).

Output format:
# Note: Your output format can follow the example provided below:
# Background: API combinations ["torch.tensor", "torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss"] of the Pytorch library, the ["tensorflow.constant", "tensorflow.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits"] of the TensorFlow library and the ["jax.numpy.array", "jax.nn.log_softmax", "jax.numpy.sum"] of the Jax library all have the same functionality. The code snippet for differential testing of these API combinations is as follows:

# Output:
logits = [[4.0, 1.0, 0.2]]
# Labels (one-hot encoded)
labels = [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]

# PyTorch
logits_pt = torch.tensor(logits, requires_grad=True)
labels_pt = torch.tensor(labels)
loss_fn_pt = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
output_pt = loss_fn_pt(logits_pt, torch.argmax(labels_pt, dim=1))
print("PyTorch Loss:", output_pt.item())

# TensorFlow
logits_tf = tf.constant(logits)
labels_tf = tf.constant(labels)
output_tf = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels_tf, logits=logits_tf)
print("TensorFlow NN Loss:", output_tf.numpy()[0])

# JAX
logits_jax = jnp.array(logits)
labels_jax = jnp.array(labels)
log_softmax = jax.nn.log_softmax(logits_jax)
output_jax = -jnp.sum(labels_jax * log_softmax)
print("JAX Loss:", output_jax)
